<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About
The short and sweet of it: I am not a fan of Nexus Mods. No real reason, I just never cared for it. The majority of mods for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl are hosted on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/) by very creative modders that I respect. Please check out their contributions to the community [<a href="#modders">modders list</a>]. I have been tweaking things I don’t care for in the game. Due to recent life developments, I prefer a more story centric game, but I am a fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and a fan of the Chornobyl lore. I have been modding the game based on suggestions from Reddit and Discord. I am providing this MOD as an alternate location to acquire a mod package. I will list all the changes in the <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a> below. I hope you enjoy the mod, it is not for everyone.
> [!TIP]
> Look for “**# Erstwhile: Modified**” comments in the code to see what I changed and where it was changed.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<a id="getting-started"></a>
# Getting Started

To install a “**~mods**” directory must be created in your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl install directory. 
1. Example: For a Steam based install you will find the following install directory.
```[Drive Steam is Installed on]:\[Steam Folder Path]\steamapps\common\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\```
Default Values:
```C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\````
2. Once you have found your installation folder you will need to create a “**~mods**” directory in the games **Paks** directory.
Default Example:
```C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\Stalker2\Content\Paks\~mods\```
3. Place this project's ErstwhileModPak.pak file in this newly created directory.
4. Play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl.
